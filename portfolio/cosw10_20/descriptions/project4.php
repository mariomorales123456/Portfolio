<ul>
    <strong><em>My requirements</em></strong>
        <li>Include at least 4 screenshots/images on your single page application.</li>
        <li>Be sure to have in-page navigation like the example project.</li>
        <li>Use HTML5 and CSS3 to layout your site with divs that allow the page layout to respond to the screen size we are viewing from. Your site should have a minimum of 3 different screen sizes - mobile, tablet and desktop. You can determine the best width of your devices. Be sure to test your responsive pages and check how the layout changes.</li>
        <li>This can be as simple or as complex as you want it to. However, I encourage you to consider page layout, color scheme, font choices, and images for an attractive looking page. Remember, this is just ONE page. No need to stress too much! </li>
        <li>Use one of our advanced CSS layout topics - FlexBox, CSS Grid, or Bootstrap for this assignment. If not using Bootstrap, hand code your media queries.</li>

        <li>User Story #4: Each section element with the class of main-section should also have an id that corresponds with the text of each header contained within it. Any spaces should be replaced with underscores (e.g. The section that contains the header "Javascript and Java" should have a corresponding id="Javascript_and_Java").</li>
