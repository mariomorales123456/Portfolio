<ul>
    <li>Create a list of character races - minimum of 4 (human, elf, troll, undead -- whatever you wish)</li>
    <li> Choose a list of character classes - minimum of 4 (paladin, ranger, rogue, wizard - whatever you wish)</li>
    <li> Create a list of at least 4 abilities (strength, dexterity, constitution, intelligence, wisdom, charisma - again, whatever you wish)</li>
</ul> 
<p>The way you want to do this - create an object for your character which should have the following properties:</p>
    <ul>
        <li> race </li>
        <li> class</li>
        <li> age</li>
        <li> ability1 (name this whatever you chose as your ability)</li>
        <li> ability2 (name this whatever you chose as your ability)</li>
        <li> ability3 (name this whatever you chose as your ability)</li>
        <li> ability4 (name this whatever you chose as your ability)</li>
    </ul>
<p>Then to create the values for these items in your object do the following:</p>  
    <ul>
        <li>For race and class, choose a random item from your list (see my CodePen for a hint)</li>
        <li>For the age property, assign a randomly generated number for age of your character (say between 10 and 50).</li>
        <li>Randomly assign values for all 4 of your abilities. These should all be done separately. (see my CodePen for a hint)</li>
        <li>Output detailed character information to the screen. </li>
        <li>Then ask at least 2 questions for a storyline similar to our Choose Your Own Adventure game.</li>
    </ul>
