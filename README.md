# Portfolio php-update
# Website Plan:

2018-2020:

Build out portfolio while completing webdev education.

-The rudementary portfolio & the projects displayed where of sufficient quality for a begginer
-Success

2020:

DB Building
DB -> Frontend

-Website that was hosting my DB deleted my account
-I had some functionalities working through queries using PHP but didn't get very far in the project
-Failure but I did get some practice with DB building and queries
-Since my portfolio is image & code displays, it doesn't really matter if it comes from a DB. it would be nice to just build project objects through DB queries but thats ok.

2022:

Revise Folder Structure //done
Revise Image Sizes //done
Revise Mobile Optimization //done
Add current workplace completed projects

-Coming at this with new knowledge & confidence I feel I can improve a lot of the aspects how I built this originally
-This was templated from things I learned in school but now I can probably just adapt it in whatever way I want
-WIP
