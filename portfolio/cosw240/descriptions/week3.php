<h2>Homework 3: Appearance and Customizations</h2>

<p>
This week's homework assignment is to modify your site appearance for your website topic. Search for your FREE theme (Links to an external site.) (do not use any paid themes in this class) and preview it. Do not use the default themes installed in WordPress (the Twenty Seventeen, Twenty Eighteen, Twenty Nineteen themes, etc.). Once you find one that you like, activate it. Find a theme that you will be happy to use on a long term basis.
</p>
<p>
After your theme is activated, go to the Customizer and walk through every section. Make changes as you see necessary. Change your site images to something related to your topic. Decide upon a final Site Title and Tagline in the Site Identity section.
</p>
<p>
Go to the Widgets and check the options of all of the currently active widgets. Make changes where necessary. Apply three other widgets. Decide which widgets would work best on your site. Be sure to check the widgets on EVERY page of your site because they change from page to page. Logically think about what would work for each page.

Create one more blog post for your WordPress site to continue promoting your original content and adding to the website. Use the best practices for content creation tips from last week's discussion activity.
