<h3>Homework 5: Users</h3>

<p>
This week we will work with our User accounts and profiles. We will also search for a User plugin that would work well with our website and install/activate it.

<p>
Create at least two other user accounts with two different user roles. After reading the learning resources, determine which two user roles would work best for your website. When you add an account, you might want to create the password through the admin menu, instead of having it assigned via email. Your choice though!
You will need to login as all of your user accounts (there should be 3 - one admin and the two you just created above.) Create separate user profiles for each of your accounts. 
Search for at least one User plugin and install/activate it in your account. You might want to do some research with your favorite search engine and see what the WordPress community recommends for User plugins. Be sure to share information about your chosen User plugin in this week's discussion forum. 
Create a blog post written by one of your new users and publish it on your website.
