<h2>WW1</h2>
 <p>Churchill's career began in 1900. He was elected as a member of parliament in 1904, and began his climb up the ranks for about a decade. He became Lord Admiral (head of the Royal Navy) at that time.

<h2>WW2</h2>
<p>Churchill remained politically active while he was out of office - writing and giving speeches. He strongly opposed german appeasement, and when the then current prime minister Chamberlain resigned due to poor performance Churchill was elected the new prime minister. Churchill's leadership during the war is regarded as crucial in achieving victory over the nazis. His personality and speeches kept british morale high even when germany had destroyed many british cities through bombing. He also led successful campaigns in South Africa and Italy - as well as coordinating with for the landing in Normandy. In 1945 after the war had ended he was unfortunately voted out but he continued to give speeches against Soviet control in eastern europe. <p>
