                <ul>
                <li>Create a button that will call a function that will ask for user input to add more qualities to the list. They should be able to continue to click the button and add items that will continue to add to the list.  Add the elements to the bottom of the list. Add a paragraph confirming that an item was added to the list. </li>
               <li> Create a second button that will call a function that will highlight three random qualities using Math.random() from the list. Be sure to first check that there are three items on the list or you might run into some problems. The highlight should be a different background color (similar to "cool" in the example) or somehow noticeably different. Additionally add a paragraph that says "The top qualities are highlighted below" somewhere on the page.</li>
               <li> Create a third button that will call a function that will randomly remove 1 of the qualities from the list. Add a paragraph that confirms an item was removed.</li>
               <li> confirm password (with an option for SHOW password on both fields) </li>
                </ul>
