        <h2>What is Git</h2>
    </header>
    <p>
       The "Git" in GitHub is important to understand because it is one of the ways that developers organize their code/data.
    </p>    
        <ul>
            <li>Subversion</li>
            <li>CVS</li>
            <li>Mercurial</li>
        </ul>
    <p>  
        These are other "control" systems which do the same thing but Git is one of the most popular ones. It is also the way developers can collaborate since the code/data is automatically updated as each person add to it. If this system of control didn't exist then it'd be similiar to updating a document but only creating new copies that didn't merge - it'd be chaos.

    <h3>"Forking"</h3>
    <p>
    This is an important function which makes GitHub so useful. When a developer creates a folder for a project, he can allow other developers to "fork" it ie. create a duplicate in their own Github account and work it individually. These allows developers to share their code and allow others to add to seamlessly. You might wonder how then can this new version of the original version be intrigrated back, but that is also built in to Github.
        </p>
    <h3>"Pull" Requests</h3>
    <p>
        These function is extremely useful. So you've allowed other developers to fork your original work and work on it. However you also made adjustments to the base code and improved it. By "pull" requesting the other developers work Github will try to merge both files together. Grant it the code that forked must be a completely new addition as opposed to an adjustment to the base code - as that could cause overwriting issues. But if it was you that forked the original work and added to it, and the original owner adjusted the base code you can also "pull" request the new version in to your own work. So pull requesting works both ways as long as any adjustments are new. This function automates a large amount of manual intigration.

    </figure>
    <p>
        Previously mentioned was the idea of a developer folder. Github calls it a repository - a project folder where you store your code. When someone forks your project they copy the entire folder. 
    </p>
    <ul class="required">
        <li></li>
        <li></li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Creaing a repository is simple. Once you completed your profile there should be a drop menu on the top right of your screen where your profile is. There should be a plus sign that can clicked on that takes you the repository creation page. There you enter the name of it and click create! This will be the folder for your project.
    </p>

        <figcaption>Commiting ie. saving changes to code</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
        When you are adjusting code on Github it isn't automatically saved. In order to save your progress you need to "commit" the changes to whatever branch you are working on.
    </p>
    <p>
        A big part of it is logging each "commit" so others can keep track of what changes happened and why they happened. When working on code alone this isn't as useful but in a collaborative effort it helps to organize the work that others are doing. Above the document you are working on there is a "commit" button to save the log.

        <figcaption>Merging changes from a forked branch to the master branch</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>When another developer forks (copies and works on that copy) your work they can request to merge any additional work you did on the original or to have their work merged with your original. This is important because otherwise you'd have to update each document individually.
    </p>
    <p>
        When you are working on any branch there is a "Pull request" button on the top left that can be clicked on to merge two branches together. It will create a request that the "mergee" can decline or accept to merge two sets of code.
