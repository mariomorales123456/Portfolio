<h3>Purpose</h3>
<p class="links"><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/angular/">W3 Schools</a>
<a href="https://angularjs.org/">Angular JS</a></p>
<p>Angular JS unlike vanilla JavaScript seems to be far more intigrated with HTML. JavaScript would generally identify an html elemement(s) by ID or class, then add an event listener and then run a script based on that event. Angular JS let's you add variables, objects, arrays and scripts direclty to HTML. </p>
<p>I can see Angular JS being effective if you have script that can be intigrated locally in to HTML. It is also easier to increase interactivity with website users because you can have the script change attributes easily.</p>

<h3>Tutorials</h3> 
<p class="links"><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/angular/">W3 Schools</a>
<a href="http://www.learn-angular.org/#!/lessons/the-essentials">Learn Angular</a></p>
<p>The basics of the tutorials on Angular JS go over expressions which are a type of variable that can be plugged in inside HTML tags or inbewteen. Modules and directives define the script used for expressions. Data binding is a type of expression that specifically binds to an element as opposed to using the {{}} syntax.</p>
<p>Advanced concepts in the tutorial include controllers, filters and scopes. These act as the functions imported in to the document, and affect expressions based on where they are plugged in. It also has an HTTP service to interact with AJAX.</p>

<h3>Community Resources</h3> 
<p class="links"><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/angular?sort=newest&page=2&pagesize=15">Stack Overflow</a> <a href="https://github.com/angular/angular/tree/master/.circleci">GitHub</a></p>
<p>Github seems to have established code and plug-ins to use with Angular JS. There isn't as many updates on it. I also don't see many question posts. <br>
Stack Overflow is definitely more aimed towards any questions users have about Angular JS. Both sources have their uses.</p>

<h3>Examples</h3>

<p>The sites had a lot of interactive qualities that were more feasiable with Angular as opposed to vanilla JS. They were able to create advanced filtering with sliders that dynamically changed the content.</p>
