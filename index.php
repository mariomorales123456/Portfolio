2022:

My web server ended up being deleted (along with the database I had started)

So for the moment being I'll just leave it in HTML. The information output isn't veyr heavy so there's really no need to use a DB other than practice.

Just focusing on backend optimization of images, code and folder structure. Also adding new projects that I've done through my workplace.
