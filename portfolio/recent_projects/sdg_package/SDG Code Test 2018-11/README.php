<p>## Overview</p>
<ul><li>
The purpose of this test is to see how well you can code a responsive component using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Matching the design is equally important as writing clean, semantic code.
</li></ul>

<p>## Rules</p>
<ul>
<li>* It's very important to match the design. This component came out of a project and is indicative of the type of work you'll encounter. </li>
<li>* JavaScript must be hand coded using Vanilla ES5/ES6+.</li>
<li>* Please do not use any JavaScript plugins, frameworks, or libraries (React, jQuery, Lodash, etc.).</li>
<li>* Must work bug-free on iOS, Android, Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Edge, and IE11+.</li>
<li>* If you choose to use some sort of CLI compilation, include a compiled folder so that the HTML file can be dragged directly into the browser.</li>
<li>* Upload a zip file to Dropbox, Google Drive, or any other semi private storage service.</li>
</ul>

<p>## Bonus</p>
<ul>
<li>* Write OOP JavaScript.</li>
<li>* Add CSS transitions to accordion and tab events.</li>
<li>* Create accordion + and - icons with pure CSS.</li>
<li> Use SASS or LESS or any other preprocessor.</li>
</ul>

<p>## Design Notes</p>
<ul>
<li>* Font used is Open Sans Bold and Regular.</li>
<li>* Tablet/Desktop PSD should account for any view larger than 767px.</li>
<li>* If you do not have Photoshop, either download a trial version or view the attached `jpgs` for reference.</li>
</ul>
