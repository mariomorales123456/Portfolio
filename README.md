# Portfolio php-update
# Website Plan:

2018-2020:

Build out portfolio while completing webdev education.

-The rudementary portfolio & the projects displayed where of sufficient quality for a begginer
-Success

2020:

DB Building
DB -> Frontend

-Website that was hosting my DB deleted my account
-I had some functionalities working through queries using PHP but didn't get very in the project
-Failure but I did get some practice with DB building and queries
-Since my portfolio is image & code displays, it really doesn't make sense to use a DB anyways, most modern frameworks use server direct URLs for images.

2022:

Revise Folder Structure
Revise Image Sizes
Revise Mobile Optimization
Add current workplace completed projects

-Coming at this with new knowledge & confidence I feel I can improve a lot of the aspects how I built this originally
-This was templated from things I learned in school but now I can probably just adapt it in whatever way I want
-WIP
